                What is Combat Critters?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Combat Critters is a deck management card game that allows players to build and manage their own custom deck of cards. After creating a deck that perfectly suits their needs, they can take it to battle against opponents. These opponents provide players with the same thrilling battle experience as playing the game with physical cards at a table. The increasing difficulty of these opponents also gives players a reason to progress their deck. With our currency system, players can fully curate their own deck of cards to use in battle. Currency is obtained in various ways such as selling cards or winning battles. With this currency, players can buy new cards on the market place, building upon their own deck. Players will be able to share their favourite hand-crafted decks with friends. Additionally, they can request to trade cards with friends if they are looking for an upgrade or want to help their friend’s progress in the game. Our trade-up system allows players to upgrade their cards, ensuring their decks stay fresh and always get stronger. They can also open up various card packs that will grant them access to new cards, helping them build out their personal decks.
